Information
- Deadline: Friday 14.10.2022 at 23:59
- This is a mandatory assignment
- Can be solved individually or in groups of up to 3. If you work in a group of 3 you will be expected to have more code than if working alone.
- On the next page you are presented with 2 different cases. You are to choose 1 of them.
- Since this is a closed school task you can freely use images, you find on the internet.
- Have fun!!!

Technologies
- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Techniques
- Semantic coding
- Diverse CSS code for styling content.
- Grid system. Below both are to be used in the solution:
    o CSS3 Grid system (display: grid;) 
    o Bootstrap grid system
- Media Queries
- FontAwesome
- BEM (don’t need to use it on all, but rather on a part to show you understand the technique)
- JavaScript (main points):
    o ES6+ techniques such as filter(), map(), forEach()
    o Array with object literal and functions related to this o localStorage
    o module
    o arrow functions
    o IIFE

Thinks to reflect over
- Is the code tidy, structured, and variables, functions, etc are named in a way so that other developers can develop it further easily?
- Do I have unnecessary code repetition?


Hi, frontend developers!
We have gotten 2 assignments from 2 companies which we need you to solve. Please select 1 of the 2 assignments below. They are pure frontend solutions.

Assignment alternative 2: Pop stars
One of the biggest music industry labels has come to us for making a solution that promotes their pop stars. There is different information that may be interesting to know about a pop star, such as representative songs, instruments, etc., but you are granted the possibility to decide what information can be interesting.

PS! Both solutions should make use of pictures of mentioned people.

Main functionality
You will make the following 4 web pages with the following functionality that uses the same localStorage. Note that the functionality can be implemented in many alternative ways and that you can add different “side functionalities” (simple example of many possible: show number of results after search, add styling dynamic to elements based on properties etc. etc.).
Note that for the first 2 web pages must use grid system: you must choose Bootstrap grid system to implement one page, while CSS3 Grid system (display: grid) for the other.

Web page 1
- Show all
Web page 2
- Search page. Add at least 2 different search functions (remember that if in group more is expected).
Web page 3
- Save new
Web page 4
- Update
- Delete
